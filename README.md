Un-official inplementation of MVSS-Net  which was proposed in ICCV 2021 by Chengbo Dong et al, includes code for training!.


What need to point out is that, the original repo is laking of the training code, links is here: [OFFICAL MVSS-Net link](https://github.com/dong03/MVSS-Net/)

> We need to point out that many researchers reported that they faild to reproduce the result in their paper. This is also our goal when building this repo, but in the end, our re-implementation also fails and the metrics are  far from the metrics in the paper on the Columbia and COVER datasets. 
> You could disscuss this phenomenon with researchers through this links: [Zhihu(a Chinese forum)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/422549140); [Issues of the offical repo](https://github.com/dong03/MVSS-Net/issues)

If you want to train this Model with the CASIAv2 dataset, we provide a revised version of CASIAv2 datasets, which corrected several mistakes in the original datasets provided by the author. Details can find in the [link](https://github.com/SunnyHaze/CASIA2.0-Corrected-Groundtruth) shown below:
